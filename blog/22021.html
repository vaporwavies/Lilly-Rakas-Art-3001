    <p style="margin-left: 15px;margin-right: 15px;"> &emsp;To remain sane I need to be continuously viewing animals.</br>
        &emsp;It started with snails. 5 Cornu aspersum in a glass terrarium. They are sweet and </br>
    surprisingly fun to interact with when they're awake; however, they sleep for days at a time.</br>
    I needed more stimulation. </br>
    &emsp;Then came my cat, Snuffy. If I'm honest, he's plenty; he endlessly demands attention, and </br>
    he's extremely entertaining. I used to think he was more like a dog than a cat. Now I realize </br>
    that he is much more like a rat. </br>
    &emsp;Then came a fish. My first Betta was named Cobalt, and he lived about 5 months before succumbing</br>
    to pet-store genetics. A few months later came Faust, a white and pink betta. He's doing well.</br>
    He hates his reflection more than anything. Accompanying him is Mephisto and his children, </br>
    a legion of multi-color Apple Snails. They look like a little army of organic roombas. </br>
    &emsp;Constant exposure to r/BallPython eventually compelled me to get my next pet, Daisy.</br>
    During the day, I call her my pet water dish. Her resting place of choice is beneath her</br>
    big ceramic bowl, and she only makes herself known by wiggling the water in the dish.</br>
    During the night, she comes out and snakes about. She likes humans because they're warm. </br>
    Owning a snake needed I had to feed a snake. The rats and mice I bought for her were kept in </br>
    depressing conditions; I decided to take matters into my own hands. Then came my rats.</br>
    &emsp;I recieved my first rats for free; I named them Gemma, Ruby, Frank, and Jones. Ruby was sick,</br>
    and she didn't survive for long. I was confronted with the fragility of rats' lives early on</br>
    in my keeping of them. I haven't lost the habit of checking for the movement of breathing every </br>
    time I see them sleeping. </br>
    &emsp;Sometimes keeping rats feels like keeping itty-bitty monkeys. They are clever, communicative, and </br>
    extremely capable of thwarting your attempts to contain them. Just now I had to take a break from </br>
    writing this because one of them came and insisted that I throw her onto a cushion over and over, like</br>
    a little kid. If I didn't she would nibble my toes. </br>
    &emsp;The culling is without a doubt the hardest part of this process. I select a few of the friendliest ones</br>
    of each litter to keep and adopt out, because if I didn't, I would probably succumb to despair. My oldest girls</br>
    have only had one litter each- they both had so many combined that I haven't needed them to breed again,</br>
    and won't until the spring. </br>
    &emsp;The way my cat regards my rats is one of the most life-affirming things I see on a regular basis. Snuffy</br>
    is very vocal; he has a language that I am well-acquainted with at this point. The vocalizations he uses </br>
    with the rats are identical to his vocalizations to other cats, specifically kittens. He has a very markedly</br>
    different vocalization when he sees something he regards as prey. I have no doubt that Snuffy believes the rats</br>
    are a collection of weird kittens that I cruelly refuse to allow him to play with. </br>
    </br>
    &emsp; I don't have much to say about HTML or CSS at the moment. I've got animals on the mind. </p>
