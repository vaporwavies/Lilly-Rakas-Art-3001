    <h2>Sickness and the Internet</h2>
    <p>I've always struggled with my health, and this came to a head in the Winter of 2018.</p>
    <p>is when I caught mono, the virus that would go on to wreck my system in a way </br>
    that I'm still suffering from. Ever since catching mono I've had to deal with this </br>
    fun and funky array of symptoms:</p> 
   <p>>Fainting upon standing (this is a big one)</p> 
   <p>>General difficulty with eating and digestion</p> 
   </p>>Migraines</p> 
    <p>>A fun little thing I've dubbed the "Wheel of Symptoms," where every other week or so a </br>
    new problem crops up that I have to deal with.</p> 
    <p>In some ways, the recent transition to a more internet-centric lifestyle has been a great </br>
    relief for me.</p> 
    <p>In other ways, I feel like my ability to rest is even more limited.</p> 
    <p>My productivity catalyst is constantly a few feet away, voluntarily unused as my head throbs</br>
    beneath my left eyeball, its closed metal shell taunting "you can't even do this simple thing!"</p> 
    <p>I try to sleep without guilt.</p> 
    <p>Sleep, which my body demands greedily, is the capitalist artist's curse. Success seems to be </br>
    built on a lack of need; no need to eat, no need to sleep. Only nonstop production, a self-enforced </br>
    policy of overwork and disregard for self.</p> 
    <p>I often find myself so far away from this productive ideal that I fall into despair.</p> </br></br>

    <p>There's a phrase I once heard repeated,</p> 
    <p>"You have four burners. One is family, one is friends, one is health, and one is work.</p>
    <p>"To be successful, you have to shut off one of those burners.</p> 
    <p>"To be REALLY successful, you have to shut off two."</p> 
    <p>Generalizations like this tend to bother me, and this one isn't exempt. Yet, it still comes </br>
    to mind regularly.</p> 
    <p>Which of my burners are on? And which could I do without?</p>
