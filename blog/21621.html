    <h2>2/16/21</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;margin-right: 15px;">I think human beings tend to react the same way to being snowed in regardless of the level
    of external responsibility is present. Even though so few people I know actually have to
    commute to their jobs or classes, when the snow begins to pile up, it becomes hard to ignore
    the siren's song that starts emanating from your bed. On this, I blame my late submission
    of this blog post. <br>
    There's something highly satisfying about learning CSS. I had taken this class previously,
    but I couldn't say that my previous instructor's teaching style was particularly techinically-
    inclined, and so I came out of that experience with fundamental knowledge of HTML and 
    practically no knowledge of CSS. <br>
    If I had to compare the experience to something, it would be a balancing puzzle; like trying to
    fit as many items as you can on an increasingly-large plate without tipping it over. It takes
    the following pattern: make a couple adjustments, check for stability, and either undo or 
    continue. <br>
    The first project is coming together at a good clip; the landing page now looks practically
    identical to the proposal; styling the auxilliary pages comes next.</p>
