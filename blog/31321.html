    <h1>Academic Fatigue</h1>
    <p>
        I have been going to college for one year longer than intended. </br>
        This, in my opinion, feels like one year too long.</br>
        On one hand, I am deeply grateful that I had the opportunity to take things slow</br>
        after I became sick in 2018. On the other hand, I desperately need to no longer</br>
        be involved in an academic institution for at least a couple years. </br>
    </br>
        I sometimes have trouble juggling the fact that it is currently the most </br>
        opportune time that the world has ever known for someone like me to exist;</br>
        just a hundred years ago the technology to keep a diabetic person alive was</br>
        nonexistent, and the illness was a death sentence. </br>
        Likewise, it's the best time possible for a person like me to exist in academia.</br>
        Ohio State only began to consider architectural barriers for the disabled in the </br>
        1970's, and non-physical barriers for the disabled much more recently.</br>
        The reason that this is hard to reconcile is that everything still feels very much</br>
        like it sucks. </br>
    </br>
        I blame this on the scam-your-heart-out nature of modern-day America, which</br>
        does have its nasty fingers all over our secondary education system, as well</br>
        as the absolute lack of social supports in general. However, I doubt that the misery</br>
        associated with being disabled would disappear even if society was turned into a </br>
        cushy place for disabled people. Being sick doesn't stop sucking even when you're</br>
        getting paid.
