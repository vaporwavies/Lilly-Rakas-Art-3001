    <p>When you own rats, it is very, very easy to accidentally collect more rats.</br>
    </br>
    Whenever I see an animal rescue post on Facebook, my brain tends to static</br>
    out and I resume consciousness with the animal in hand. I'm only able to beat back the </br>
    mesmerization when I don't already have the enclosure for the animal on hand; this means</br>
    I'm able to resist the temptation of reptiles, amphibians, and other rodents, because</br>
    I'm not able to make space for them with the aquariums and cages I have on hand. But rats?</br>
    I can just keep getting rats. Specifically, I can get up to seven of each sex of rat.</br>
    Last week, I had four of each. This week, I have five each, for a total of ten. I have</br>
    strayed into the treacherous territory of double-digit rat ownership.</br>
</br>
    I just couldn't help myself. The first one is a standard-coat, black and white hooded male.</br>
    He was posted as free on a local reptile group- he was rejected by the person's python and </br>
    then grew too big for the snake to eat. There was only one picture, but the thought that</br>
    I could prevent this cutie from being choked out and eaten overtook me. And so I got him.</br>
    His name is Vinny. He likes to feel safe. He still poops every time you pick him up because</br>
    he's not used to guaranteed survival, but after his poops are out, he likes to cuddle.</br>
</br>
    The second was a female double-rex coat (mostly bald with patchy curly fur), and grey and white.</br>
    She was being sold by a small breeder who was clearing out their inventory. She is very itty</br>
    bitty and feels like a hot water bottle. She was raised to be a pet, so she's not perpetually</br>
    terrified. She's often pushed around by The Jokka, but is learning to stand up for herself.</br>
    Her name is Chrysanthemum, after the Kevin Henkes book.</br>
</br>
    This has been my rat status update.</p>
