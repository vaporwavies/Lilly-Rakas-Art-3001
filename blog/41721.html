    When you own rats, it is very, very easy to accidentally collect more rats.

    Whenever I see an animal rescue post on Facebook, my brain tends to static
    out and I resume consciousness with the animal in hand. I'm only able to beat back the 
    mesmerization when I don't already have the enclosure for the animal on hand; this means
    I'm able to resist the temptation of reptiles, amphibians, and other rodents, because
    I'm not able to make space for them with the aquariums and cages I have on hand. But rats?
    I can just keep getting rats. Specifically, I can get up to seven of each sex of rat.
    Last week, I had four of each. This week, I have five each, for a total of ten. I have
    strayed into the treacherous territory of double-digit rat ownership.
