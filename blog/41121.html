    <h1>Goodbye, OSU</h1>
    <p>&emsp; Five years total. Five years affiliated with Ohio State Arts and Sciences. Three years </br>
    affiliated with Art and Technology.  Four years of a meme-president that nearly derailed democracy</br>
    as we knew it. Came in abled, exited disabled. Mostly, I'm just tired.</br>
    &emsp;  I gained the following skills from zero: photography, 3D modeling, After Effects, a handful of coding languages,</br>
    screenprinting, woodworking, robotics, and a host of other things that have ultimately become entirely irrelevant </br>
    to my practice. I am much better at animation (stop motion and digital,) figure drawing, and color </br>
    theory. </br>
    &emsp;  I feel a touch of bitterness that my last two years were so unorthodox; I never got to have</br>
    a standard "senior experience," and I likely never will. In a way, I feel grateful that the </br>
    rest of the world is reeling with our new realities, as I feel like it gives me a little bit of</br>
    time to get back on my feet.</br>
    &emsp; I'm reminded of the dungeons and dragons podcast "The Adventure Zone". Paraphrasing:</br>
    &emsp; Clint: That's a natural 1 minus 1, which equals an initiative of zero.</br>
    &emsp; Justin: Zero initiative? Reminds me of myself after getting my degree.</br>
    &emsp; I too am feeling pretty natural-1-minus-1 about the whole prospect of entering myself into the </br>
    corporate sphere. </br>
    &emsp; Maybe I'll try to avoid it indefinitely.</br>
    &emsp;  Who knows!</br>
</br></br>
    Thank you very much.</br>
