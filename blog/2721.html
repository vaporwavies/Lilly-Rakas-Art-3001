    <h2>Voluntary Surveillance</h2>
    <p>&emsp;I was fascinated by the discussions we were having in class on Thursday surrounding</br>
    surveillance. Specifically, the dimension of surveillance that I believe is unique to </br>
    the era of the internet; voluntarily subjecting yourself to surveillance.</br>
    &emsp;This takes a couple different forms, some pushing the definition of "voluntary." For example,</br>
    my father still keeps insisting on using Amazon Echo devices despite being entirely</br>
    aware of the alarming privacy violations inherent with those devices. This is a legally-sound,</br>
    ethically-questionable application of voluntary surveillance, with usually the same level</br>
    of genuine informed consent as the average person who clicks "I have read the Terms of Use."</br>
    &emsp;What I am more interested in isn't really this faustian "your data for our service" situation</br>
    that most tech corporations subject their customers to, it's the more self-imposed version</br>
    of voluntary surveillance that you can find on nearly every social platform.</br>
    Of course, this attitude is in the best interests of those social media corporations, and </br>
    it is eagerly fostered. </br>
    &emsp;A willingness to constantly be allowing people to observe you comes with the implied </br>
    consequence of fame. And frequently, with persistence, people who subject themselves to</br>
    constant surveillance find immense success; the more deeply you allow people into your</br>
    life, the more reason they feel there is to stay.</br>
    &emsp;An intense version of this is the 24-hour live stream. While it's unusual (but not unheard of)</br>
    to open up your life to strangers completely, it's much more common to see fragments of someone's</br>
    life; a picturesque view through a window, or a view of interesting animals; these constant</br>
    mild invasions into strangers' lives is something we've generally come to have taken for</br>
    granted.</p>
