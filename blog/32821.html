    Things I Have and Things I Am <br>
    <br>
    Much academic writing, discourse, and teeth-gnashing has been devoted to the subject of<br>
    what exactly do we call sick people.<br>
    Part of this semantic argument includes the difference between "to have" and "to be."<br>
    "To have" implies a lack of attachment. It implies a cure; if you have something, then there<br>
    is a chance that one day you may not have it.<br>
    "To be" is identifying. It implies something innate.<br>
    I have Dysautonomia. Despite the lack of an obvious cure, it's something that I could concievably<br>
    be rid of one day.<br>
    I have Diabetes, and I am Diabetic. Short of a miraculous medical breakthrough, there is nothing<br>
    that will change the fact that my pancreas doesn't work anymore. Yet, something about that<br>
    ambiguious possibility of a medical breakthrough places Diabetes in both the "to have" and "to be"<br>
    category.<br>
    "Disabled" is a word that feels comfortable to me. Not insulting or minimizing; just a <br>
    pragmatic way to express "can't do as much."<br>
    I can understand why some of my disabled peers are resistant to having the term applied to them;<br>
    American culture in particular inculcates an image of hopelessness and despair, due <br>
    largely to the poverty trap that makes up our only social safety net for the disabled.<br>
    I argue with myself sometimes; are we really so far off from the days of sanatoriums and <br>
    forcible medical institutions? Or have we simply replaced these institutions by allowing<br>
    people to die?<br>
