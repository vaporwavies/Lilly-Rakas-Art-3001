    <h3>So, what are you going to do after you graduate?</h3>
    <p>
        My dreams of becoming a "proper" animator were probably dashed begininning in </br>
        October of 2018. This is when I caught mono, ultimately becoming chronically ill from it.</br>
        The abuses permitted in and typical of the animation industry felt like something</br>
        I was able to handle before that. </br>
        When I was "healthy," I would work self-imposed 18-20 hour days, anything to </br>
        complete my vision in time for a deadline. After developing Dysautonomia, my </br>
        ability to continue to work on sheer force of will shriveled up and died. My</br>
        exhaustion won out. I was no longer able to do things just because I wanted to do them;</br>
        my body had imposed limits. Trying to betray those limits would only lead to intolerably</br>
        poor work and days-long energy crashes; I now had to obey an arbitrary set of rules</br>
        that seemed to change without warning.</br>
        Before that, what I wanted to do after college seemed so clear-cut. I would graduate,</br>
        I would get whatever grunt-work job at whatever animation studio I could manage, and I'd</br>
        tough it out until I made a name for myself. I knew those jobs meant crunch work,</br>
        absurd overtime and sleeping, eating, and working at the studio; when it comes to</br>
        oversaturated creative "dream jobs," whoever can't handle the pressure will just be replaced</br>
        by someone who can, and couple years ago I spontaneously found myself transformed from </br>
        someone who can into someone who can't. </br>
        Ever since then that cursed question "what are you going to do after you graduate?" has </br>
        become more of an issue. I know what I want to do, but I no longer know what I can do.</br>
        When people who know me well ask, I have to resist hitting back with "Did you forget how</br>
        my life was turned upside down a few years back? Why the hell would I know the answer</br>
        to that?"
