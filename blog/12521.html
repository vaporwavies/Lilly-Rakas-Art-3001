    <h1>What happened to Internet Art?</h1>
    <p>Over anything else, one observation has stood out to me as I've attempted to gather internet artworks<br>for the are.na assignment.</p>
    <p>New works are *stunningly* difficult to find.</p>
    <p>The artists that I'm familiar with that I've considered staples in the genre, have slowed their <br>output to a trickle, or a dead halt.</p>
    <p>Has the novelty of the internet worn off? Is this a failure on my part, or on hosting platforms'<br>ability to disseminate this kind of artwork?</p>
    <p>In a time when the internet has become so crucial, why does this medium seem so dead?</p>
