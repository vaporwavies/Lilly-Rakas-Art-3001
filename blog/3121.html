    <h3>Animal Collaborators</h3>
    <p>A lot of my work in the part few years has focused on the animal as artist, or </br>
    as an artistic collaborator. </br>
    My first stint into this was with snails; using variously colored fruit and</br>
    vegetable dyes, I dripped the colors onto their shells as they made their way </br>
    across a paper sculpture, gnawing at it along the way. </br>
    The snail does not have a great sense of agency, nor of creativity. To collaborate</br>
    with them, they needed to be tricked into cooperation with treats. This is not a </br>
    particularly emotionally satisfying collaboration.</br>
    I've attempted to use my cat as a collaborator a couple times; my stop motion</br>
    animation "Snuffy" was shot with him intentionally allowed to disrupt and </br>
    interact with the frame. Unlike the snails, he didn't need to be swindled into </br>
    cooperating. He remained in the general shooting location out of willingness</br>
    to share space with me; I am grateful to him for that.</br>
    My final senior project is another animal collaboration, this time with rats.</br>
    I will be using the skills I learned in this class to assemble a website that </br>
    is intended to resemble a standard artist's residence website. My rat's enclosure</br>
    will be the residence, and my rats will be the artists. The fact that they are rats</br>
    will be under-emphasized. </br>
    The rats have a level of cognition much more similar to a cat's than to a snail's. </br>
    When supplied with random objects, it sometimes seems as though they are used for creative</br>
    expression; always with a practical leaning, but creative nonetheless.</p>
